website for small group study

This is a website that I created for a local small-group ladies Bible study using my own CSS mini-framework 
as a test to see what I could accomplish without bootstrap or another framework. It is not anything special for sure,
but it was a good execise for a non-designer like myself who routinely uses bulma for nearly all UI.
